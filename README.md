## Introduction
Here is another project I am embarking on just so i can learn HTML and CSS as I strive to be betther at web development.

I will be making testimonial cards for a website. These are those statements or visuas showing cutomer feedback on a partticular product. 
I got the idea from the [Roadmap.sh frontend page.](https://roadmap.sh/projects/testimonial-cards)
